# Epwing2AnkiEmbeddedExamples

This is a fork of [Epwing2Anki](https://sourceforge.net/projects/epwing2anki/), an application that allows you to quickly create Anki cards from a word list.

This fork aims to add the ability to take example sentences not only from dictionaries, but also from the wordfile itself, adding furigana in the same manner as it is done for the dictionary examples.
